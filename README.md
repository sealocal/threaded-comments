#threaded-comments

This Rails app allows people to comment in threads, replying to others' comments.

A few rules:

  - A full name and email address is required to participate.
  - Comments cannot be empty.
  - You cannot edit or update another user's comments.


The current state of the app redirects you to a page that allows you to submit your comment (just like on that news for hackers website).  In the future, comments will be editable inline or on the page!
